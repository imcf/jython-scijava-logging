# Supplementary stuff

This directory contains additional scripts and stuff that can't or shouldn't be
packaged in the `.jar` file by Maven but is rather meant as an example, to be
run manually or copied over to a specific location inside a Fiji installation.

## Logger usage example

The script [`example.py`](scripts/example.py) shows how to use the scijava
logging adapter from Jython code and demonstrates its behaviour in the
*Console/Log* window. To use it, simply open it with the Script Editor and hit
the `Run` button.
